   # Ulmarra

   **By Henry Kendall**



    Alone alone!<br>
    With a heart like a _stone_,<br> 
    She maketh her _moan_<br> 
    At the feet of the trees,<br> 
    With her face on her knees,<br> 
    And her hair streaming over;<br> 
    Wildly, and wildly, and wildly;<br> 
    For she misses the tracks of her lover!<br> 
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?<br> 
    Oh, where are the tracks of her lover?<br> 

    Go by go by!<br> 
    They have told her a _lie_,<br> 
    Who said he was _nigh_,<br> 
    In the white-cedar glen<br> 
    In the camps of his men:<br> 
    And she sitteth there weeping <br>
    Weeping, and weeping, and weeping,<br>
    For the face of a warrior sleeping!<br> 
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?<br> 
    Oh! where is her warrior sleeping?<br> 

    A dream! a dream!<br>
    That they saw a bright _gleam_<br> 
    Through the dusk boughs _stream_,<br> 
    Where wild bees dwell,<br> 
    And a tomahawk fell,<br> 
    In moons which have faded;<br> 
    Faded, and faded, and faded,<br> 
    From woods where a chieftain lies shaded!<br> 
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?<br> 
    Oh! where doth her chieftain lie shaded?<br> 

    Bewail! bewail!<br> 
    Who whispered a _tale_,<br> 
    That they heard on the _gale_,<br> 
    Through the dark and the cold,<br> 
    The voice of the bold;<br> 
    And a boomerang flying;<br>
    Flying, and flying, and flying?<br> 
    Ah! her heart it is wasted with crying<br>
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?<br>
