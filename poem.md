 # Ulmarra

    **By Henry Kendall**



    _Alone alone!_
    With a heart like a stone,
    She maketh her moan
    At the feet of the trees,
    With her face on her knees,
    And her hair streaming over;
    Wildly, and wildly, and wildly;
    For she misses the tracks of her lover!
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?
    Oh, where are the tracks of her lover?

    _Go by go by!_
    They have told her a lie,
    Who said he was nigh,
    In the white-cedar glen
    In the camps of his men:
    And she sitteth there weeping
    Weeping, and weeping, and weeping,
    For the face of a warrior sleeping!
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?
    Oh! where is her warrior sleeping?

    _A dream! a dream!_
    That they saw a bright gleam
    Through the dusk boughs stream,
    Where wild bees dwell,
    And a tomahawk fell,
    In moons which have faded;
    Faded, and faded, and faded,
    From woods where a chieftain lies shaded!
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?
    Oh! where doth her chieftain lie shaded?

    _Bewail! bewail!_
    Who whispered a tale,
    That they heard on the gale,
    Through the dark and the cold,
    The voice of the bold;
    And a boomerang flying;
    Flying, and flying, and flying?
    Ah! her heart it is wasted with crying
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra?
    Oh! her heart it is wasted with crying!
