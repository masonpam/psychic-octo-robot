 # Ulmarra

    **By Henry Kendall**



    _Alone alone!_ <br>
    With a heart like a stone, <br>
    She maketh her moan <br>
    At the feet of the trees, <br>
    With her face on her knees, <br>
    And her hair streaming over; <br>
    Wildly, and wildly, and wildly; <br>
    For she misses the tracks of her lover! <br>
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra? <br>
    Oh, where are the tracks of her lover? <br>

    _Go by go by!_ <br>
    They have told her a lie, <br>
    Who said he was nigh, <br>
    In the white-cedar glen <br>
    In the camps of his men: <br>
    And she sitteth there weeping <br>
    Weeping, and weeping, and weeping, <br>
    For the face of a warrior sleeping! <br>
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra? <br>
    Oh! where is her warrior sleeping? <br>

    _A dream! a dream!_ <br>
    That they saw a bright gleam <br>
    Through the dusk boughs stream, <br>
    Where wild bees dwell, <br>
    And a tomahawk fell, <br>
    In moons which have faded; <br>
    Faded, and faded, and faded, <br>
    From woods where a chieftain lies shaded! <br>
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra? <br> 
    Oh! where doth her chieftain lie shaded? <br>

    _Bewail! bewail!_ <br>
    Who whispered a tale, <br>
    That they heard on the gale, <br>
    Through the dark and the cold, <br>
    The voice of the bold; <br>
    And a boomerang flying; <br>
    Flying, and flying, and flying? <br>
    Ah! her heart it is wasted with crying <br>
    Do you hear her, Ulmarra? <br>
    Oh! her heart it is wasted with crying! <br>
